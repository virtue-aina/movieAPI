# Movie API Improvement Tasks

This document contains a comprehensive list of improvement tasks for the Movie API project. Each task is categorized and prioritized to help guide the development process.

## Code Organization and Naming Conventions

1. [ ] Standardize repository naming conventions (ReviewRepo vs MovieRepository)
2. [ ] Organize packages by feature rather than by layer (e.g., movie/controller, movie/service instead of controllers/MovieController)
3. [ ] Create DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to separate API models from domain models
4. [ ] Add version information to model classes for optimistic locking
5. [ ] Remove empty lines and standardize code formatting across all files

## Architecture and Design Patterns

6. [ ] Replace field injection (@Autowired) with constructor injection for better testability
7. [ ] Implement a proper layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
8. [ ] Add a global exception handler using @ControllerAdvice
9. [ ] Create interfaces for services to support better dependency injection
10. [ ] Implement the repository pattern more thoroughly with custom query methods
11. [ ] Remove circular dependency in pom.xml (project depending on itself)

## Error Handling and Validation

12. [ ] Implement input validation using Bean Validation (JSR 380)
13. [ ] Add proper error handling for cases where resources are not found
14. [ ] Create custom exception classes for different error scenarios
15. [ ] Implement the TODO for validation in ReviewService
16. [ ] Add logging for exceptions and important operations
17. [ ] Return appropriate HTTP status codes for different error scenarios

## Documentation and Comments

18. [ ] Add Javadoc comments to all public classes and methods
19. [ ] Implement Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation
20. [ ] Complete the empty sections in pom.xml (license, developers, SCM)
21. [ ] Create a more detailed README with API usage examples
22. [ ] Add inline comments for complex logic
23. [ ] Document configuration properties and environment variables

## Testing

24. [ ] Create unit tests for all service classes
25. [ ] Implement integration tests for controllers
26. [ ] Add repository tests with an embedded MongoDB
27. [ ] Set up test coverage reporting
28. [ ] Implement end-to-end tests for critical user journeys
29. [ ] Add performance tests for key endpoints

## Configuration Management

30. [ ] Move configuration to application.yml for better readability
31. [ ] Create different profiles for development, testing, and production
32. [ ] Implement proper environment variable validation
33. [ ] Add support for configuration reloading
34. [ ] Document all configuration options
35. [ ] Implement a configuration service for centralized configuration management

## Security

36. [ ] Implement authentication and authorization (as mentioned in the TODO)
37. [ ] Add HTTPS support
38. [ ] Implement input sanitization to prevent injection attacks
39. [ ] Add rate limiting for API endpoints
40. [ ] Implement CORS configuration
41. [ ] Add security headers to HTTP responses
42. [ ] Implement proper password hashing if user authentication is added

## Performance Optimization

43. [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed data
44. [ ] Implement pagination for endpoints that return lists
45. [ ] Optimize database queries with proper indexing
46. [ ] Add database connection pooling configuration
47. [ ] Implement asynchronous processing for non-critical operations
48. [ ] Add monitoring and performance metrics

## DevOps and CI/CD

49. [ ] Set up a CI/CD pipeline
50. [ ] Implement containerization with Docker
51. [ ] Create Kubernetes deployment configurations
52. [ ] Add health check endpoints
53. [ ] Implement automated database migrations
54. [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting

## Feature Enhancements

55. [ ] Add search functionality for movies
56. [ ] Implement filtering and sorting options for movie lists
57. [ ] Add user management if authentication is implemented
58. [ ] Implement a rating system for reviews
